    - **A (Lot for Lot):** Best when first implementing MRP.  
    - **B, C, K, L:** Good balance between batch efficiency and fewer POs.  
    - **D, E:** Use if you want fewer POs but can tolerate high inventory.  
    - **G, H, M, N:** Careful – can generate too many PO lines.  
    - **O:** Flexible for mixed demand patterns.  
    - **P:** Manual control – use for by-products/non-critical.  
    - **Q:** Best if warehouses need flexibility with local policies.
